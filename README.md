# Creating and Evaluating a Mnemonics Serious Game for Improving Learning and Knowledge Retention
Role: Designer, Developer, and Researcher  
Duration: 1 and a half years  
Project Type: Game Design and Evaluation Study

## Problem Statement
Having found shortcomings in existing serious games that use mnemonics to teach content to players, I worked on creating my own “mnemonics serious game” called Acronimps that would account for these shortcomings and hopefully help improve players’ learning and knowledge retention further.

The goal of this project was to use the results of my previous research to create a mnemonics serious game, evaluate its effectiveness in a controlled experiment against traditional learning methods, and evaluate users’ perception of the game.

## My Role
Under a supervisor, I worked as a game designer, developer, and researcher (including UX). My responsibilities included creating a prototype, implementing it, evaluating it with participants, and cleaning and analyzing the obtained data.

Due to academic restrictions, data and code used in analysis will not be shown. Rather, I will focus on describing the procedure, limitations, results, and implications.

## Research & Discovery
First, I created a prototype of the game and periodically showed it to my supervisor and our colleagues for feedback.

Research methods included:
- Using Figma to design a low-fidelity prototype and later a high-fidelity one
- Showing the prototype in weekly meetings that involve discussing progress so I can receive feedback and improve the prototype

Second, I implemented the game and periodically showed it to my supervisor and our colleagues for feedback.

Research methods included:
- Using React Native to develop the game based on my prototype, though not strictly following it exactly
- Showing the game in weekly meetings that involve discussing progress so I can receive feedback and improve the game
- Showing the game to my supervisor outside of the weekly meetings when he has an idea for an additional change

Third, I evaluated the game’s effectiveness at improving learning and memory in an experiment with 52 participants.

Research methods included:
- Hosting in-person sessions that participants would book
- Showing a video lecture on six biology topics and giving participants time to go over the content (control group exclusively uses physical version of the slides, experimental group briefly uses it but focuses on the game after)
- Having participants take a test that involves recalling content in short-answer questions and recognizing correct answers in multiple-choice questions
- Having participants return a week later, retake the test to see their performance after prolonged non-practice, briefly revise the content, then retake the test again
- Having participants take surveys on how they feel about the game
- Cleaning the response data (particularly the recall data due to its open-ended nature) and running ANOVAs to compare results (particularly between the two participant groups)

The focus was on whether the experimental group would fare better than the control group and whether users would have high opinions of the game, thus justifying the existence of the game.

## Limitations
Our study had several limitations, some of which may have diminished the difference in performance between the two groups:
- Experimental group started after control group and during midterm period, thus possibly inhibiting their performance
- The game did not involve recognizing the exact content that would need to be recognized on the test
- Some control group participants used mnemonics even though we had not taught them to

These limitations raise the possibility that the effects of a mnemonics serious game (compared to traditional learning methods) could be even greater than what we had found.

## Insights
The main results of the experiment are listed below:
1.	The game significantly improves recall shortly after learning the content, and after one week of non-practice
2.	Its effectiveness is even more prominent in topics that are unfamiliar and/or have complex terms
3.	Users find it easy to use, enjoyable, useful, and trustworthy; they are willing to adopt it
4.	It does not significantly improve recall after a quick revision of learned content
5.	It does not significantly improve recognition at any time point

Points 1-2 show that the game will indeed help students in situations where they need to provide answers without aid, especially in topics that are relatively new to them. Point 3 shows that users will appreciate the game; along with Points 1-2, this justifies the existence of the game. Though Points 4-5 sound negative, it is possible that the game’s effect simply lessens when users become more familiar with the content and/or when they are provided with limited choices for an answer.

## Future Work
### Repeating the Experiment in Other Areas
Conduct the exact same experiment in other areas, such as a different country. We are currently working on repeating it in a Ghanaian university.

**Rationale:** Evaluating the game’s effectiveness on other populations allows us to see if the game can generalize to different populations (with possibly different education standards) rather than only benefit specific ones. 

### Repeating the Experiment with Different Subjects
Conduct the same experiment but with a subject other than biology. We are considering using history.

**Rationale:** Evaluating the game’s effectiveness regarding different subjects allows us to see if it can generalize to different subjects which are structured differently. In particular, history does not involve processes, relationships, or diagrams as much as biology does.

### Analyzing Demographics’ Effect on Game Effectiveness
Compare mean scores of different ages, genders, mnemonic/non-mnemonic use in the control group, etc., against each other.
**Rationale:** Doing so allows for insights on whether any particular demographics would benefit more from the game, and it would be good to prioritize giving the game to those demographics first.

## Reflection & Learnings
This project involved creating and evaluating a mnemonics serious game to improve learning and knowledge retention. It gave me experience in designing and implementing a game of this caliber by myself with limited assistance. It also gave me experience in conducting a multi-part in-person experiment, as well as cleaning and analyzing the obtained data.

## Why This Project Matters
This study demonstrates my ability to create a mnemonics serious game, conduct an in-person experiment, and derive results from data. The game itself can already help students fare better at their courses, and it can serve as inspiration for similar mnemonics serious games in the future. The process of the experiment and data analysis can be modified to produce variations that will serve different, but similar purposes.
